# 🌐 Micro Toolkit

Welcome to **Micro Toolkit** — an open-source organization dedicated to building lightweight, modular, and developer-friendly tools for modern applications.  

Our goal is to create a collection of reusable components, libraries, and frameworks that make development faster, simpler, and more scalable.

---

## 🚀 Mission
We believe software should be:
- **Lightweight** – small in size, fast to install, and easy to use.  
- **Modular** – every project should do one thing well and integrate smoothly.  
- **Open & Collaborative** – community-driven and transparent.  
- **Scalable** – ready to grow with your applications.  

---

## 📦 What We Build
The Micro Toolkit organization focuses on:
- Developer utilities (CLI tools, helpers, snippets)  
- Micro frameworks & libraries for **web, mobile, and backend**  
- Integrations with popular platforms & APIs  
- Templates and starter kits for rapid prototyping  

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure
Our repositories follow a clean and consistent structure:
- `docs/` → Documentation, guides, and tutorials  
- `src/` → Source code  
- `tests/` → Unit and integration tests  
- `examples/` → Practical usage examples

## 📚 Documentation
Each repository contains detailed documentation in its own `README.md`.  
Organization-wide guides will be published soon in our **Docs Hub**.
